          <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m an Australian residing in Japan since 2004. I have a wife and two children.
              In 2003 I graduated at the Australian Institute of Applied Sciences with a diploma in Anatomy and Physiology.
              In 2014, I passed the N1 (highest level) Japanese Language Proficiency Test. Those with this certification can converse in most situations in Japanese culture to a high level.

              My dream as a teenager was to be a musician. I have original music on Spotify and other streaming platforms, an album made with friends here in Japan for runners in which all music is a 180bpm and am halfway through recording an original album with a Japanese bassist and a Chinese singer.
            </p>
          <h2></h2>
            <p>My interest in IT began when I first had contact with a computer back when I was about 11 or 12 years old. My mum got a cheap computer from Cash            Converters, one with a cassette deck and it came with a book on coding. I remember copying the code to write Black Jack. I very much regret not continuing with that but am looking to make amends now at RMIT. My experience in IT is limited to trial and error, but in my family and friends circle, I’m usually the one people go to for tech help. If anything, I’m able to use Google to solve most tech problems. My hope is to learn to go further and solve programming issues as well.
            </p>
          <h2>Why I Chose RMIT</h2>
            <p>I chose RMIT because they provide an 100% online program and were highly recommended when I posted a question on Reddit about studying IT online as a mature student. Despite my relatively older age, I strongly believe that age is just a number and I can learn how to program, learn how to build an app, learn how to do things I don’t even know I want to learn how to do at RMIT.

              My expectation from studying at RMIT are to learn the ins and outs of IT including programming, troubleshooting, working in groups and other facets of working in the IT industry. As someone who will graduate in my mid-40s, my hope is to despite my age be able to hit the ground running and be at the very least a serviceable contributor and eventually excel.
