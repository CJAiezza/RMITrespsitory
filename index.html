            <article>
              <p>
            I’m an Australian residing in Japan since 2004. I have a wife and two children.
              In 2003 I graduated at the Australian Institute of Applied Sciences with a diploma in Anatomy and Physiology.<br><br>
              In 2014, I passed the N1 (highest level) Japanese Language Proficiency Test. Those with this certification can converse in most situations in
              Japanese culture to a high level.<br><br>

              My dream as a teenager was to be a musician. I have original music on Spotify and other streaming platforms, an album made with friends here in
              Japan for runners in which all music is in 180bpm and am halfway through recording an original album with a Japanese bassist and a Chinese singer.<br><br>

              I am a tactile learner, i.e. I learn by doing. This rings true for me, as I find it difficult to retain information by just listening, preferring
              to actually do. This was definitely true for me when learning Japanese. I was one who would ask questions, any question, not matter how trivial to
              the annoyance of my interlocutor but I believe it's best to ask rather and learn rather than the alternative.  I believe that open communication, a willingness
              to ask questions and being hands-on; actively working with members of a team are essential elements to successful team development.<br><br>

              <b><a href="pages/leadershipstyles.pdf">Click here for a PDF outlining my leadership style.</a></b><br><br>
              I don't know how much can be read into an online quiz like this, as there were are questions that didn't really apply to me, but I think this is an
              honest appraisal of my personality -> leadership style. I do at the very least try to be this kind of person. I'm not outgoing, growing up with a stutter
              as a child put a stop to that, but I do try to help others be a better version of themselves. Often when playing in bands, I would take on learner players. I
              strongly believe that a teacher can learn from their students' failures, "The greatest teacher, failure is." (Yoda, The Last Jedi) and successes and become better people themselves, This undoubtedly translates to
              teamwork and leading a team of individuals. This is known as the <a href="https://effectiviology.com/protege-effect-learn-by-teaching/"> Protege Effect</a>.<br><br>

              Also, morally speaking, I believe in the secular humanist moral system in which "wellbeing" is the ultimate goal. This is ultimately can be construed as a selfish
              moral system in that ultimately, we help others and help others be the best version of themselves in the hope that we can live in a mutually beneficial
              society I believe in leading by example, not by force.<br><br>

              <b><a href="pages/16personalities.jpeg">Click Here for a PDF outlining my personality test.</a></b>
              <br><br>
              I don't quite agree fully with the analysis of this personality test, as although I do consider myself hardworking, when it suits me and devoted, often
              the one who would be more likely to put the effort into a friendship, relationship and even a working relationship. This can be frustrating when working with
              teams but I hope to grow with my team and come out the other end together as better, more team oriented people.  I'm not one to is a traditionalist,
              I'm one who is often the more progressive among friends, an unapologetic leftist, nor am I one to remember birthdays. I'm although not one who needs instant
              gratification but do hope for recognition when it I feel it is deserved. On the other hand, I find being praised embarrassing.<br><br>

              I do feel that I am altruistic. Ultimately, as a secular humanist, it is beneficial to the human race to put human wellbeing at the forefront of our
              minds and work together for the betterment of the human race.<br><br>

          <div class="sectionContent">
            <article>
              <p>My interest in IT began when I first had contact with a computer back when I was about 11 or 12 years old. My mum got a cheap computer from Cash
              Converters, one with a cassette deck and it came with a book on coding. If memory serves correct, I believe
              <a href="https://www.sekaimon.com/itemdetail/353997264164?country=US&title=Vintage+GE+Computer+Program+Data+Recorder+Cassette+Player%2FRecorder+Deck+3-5158">
              this</a> is what I had. I remember copying the code to write Black Jack. I very much regret not continuing
              with that but am looking to make amends now at RMIT. My experience in IT is limited to trial and error, but in my family and friends circle, I’m usually the
              one people go to for tech help. If anything, I’m able to use Google to solve most tech problems. My hope is to learn to go further and solve programming
              issues as well.

        <div class="sectionTitle"><h2>Why I Chose RMIT</h2></div>
          <div class="sectionContent">
            <article>
              <p>I chose RMIT because they provide an 100% online program and were highly recommended when I posted a question on Reddit about studying IT online
              as a mature student. Despite my relatively older age, I strongly believe that age is just a number and I can learn how to program, learn how to build an app,
              learn how to do things I don’t even know I want to learn how to do at RMIT.<br><br>

              My expectation from studying at RMIT are to learn the ins and outs of IT including programming, troubleshooting, working in groups and other facets
               of working in the IT industry. As someone who will graduate in my mid-40s, my hope is to despite my age be able to hit the ground running and be at
                the very least a serviceable contributor and eventually excel.

          <div class="sectionContent">
            <article>
                <p>This position is for a C++ Software Engineer that will be able to work with and learn from peers with a possibility of future opportunities. It
                is a job that requires a high level of maturity and attention to detail, as it is a position in defence.<br><br>
                As someone who is a pacifist while also a realist, working in defence and helping to ensure that clients make “better and more informed” decisions
                is an exciting prospect. As someone who already lives overseas and dreamt of doing so from a very young age, while I understand that this job is
                situated in Australia, the idea that organisation being international implies that there may be possibilities of future positions abroad. That is
                incredibly exciting.<br><br>

                The job requires exemplary proficiency in C++ and a strong team ethic and team working skills. Excellent communication skills to meet the demands
                of clients is at the forefront of the company’s needs.<br><br>

                Currently, I have no knowledge of C++ but do love working in a team and collaborating in teams.<br><br>

                To meet the demands of this position, it is going to take me to first, complete the degree in IT. Then, further studies in the disciplines outlined
                 in the job advert, Computer Science and physics among them. I have an interest in physics, so earning a degree in physics as a post-grad is also
                 a compelling prospect. I don’t know how much C++ is taught in the Bachelor of IT degree, but if it’s minimal, further study in this area will be
                 conducted post-graduation.<br><br>

            <div class="sectionContent">
              <article>
                <p>
                Here I present and idea for a simple monitor placed on the rear windshield of a car to display vital information to other drivers. To circumvent having
                to keep it constantly or regularly connected to an energy source or charger, a kindle type always on display could be advantageous. It can be installed
                either using suction cups like traditional signs or a holder attached with double-sided tape. The monitor will be managed by an app to allow the user to
                choose what image to be displayed and including a custom image editor with profanity filters to ensure illicit images and messages cannot be displayed.
                <br><br>

                Any new parent has purchased and attached a “Baby on Board” sign. This seems like just a message to other drivers to be careful around them to ensure the
                safety of the “baby on board” but this also has a secondary, perhaps even more vital purpose, to notify emergency services in case of an accident that a
                baby is on board. This is a communication device. Without it, emergency services would likely have no idea that an infant is in the vicinity and if the
                parents are deceased with the infant injured and/or unconscious the unimaginable becomes an infinitely higher possibility.<br><br>

                Also consider indicators. Why do we have them? They convey to fellow motorists that one wants to turn right or left and when hazard lights are used, to
                notify other drivers to be careful around them. In some countries it is customary to use hazard lights as a “thank you” for allowing them to cut in. This
                is again, communication. Communication is key. Haven’t we all been in situations where miscommunication has led to arguments that could easily have been
                resolved simply with better communication? Being on the road is no different. If anything, the simple tools we have at our disposal in our vehicles coupled
                with the anonymity that comes with being in an enclosed and isolated space travelling at high speeds, lends itself to lack of and miscommunication.<br><br>

                Back to the monitor. “Baby on Board” signs convey only two messages, the aforementioned ones above. Perhaps a driver has other precious cargo and needs to
                drive extra carefully. That can be very frustrating to other drivers and perhaps cause road rage incidents or other forms of traffic incidents. According to
                Geico.com, road rage accidents are caused by aggressive driving acts such as tailgating, weaving and speeding. Such aggressive driving contributed to above
                50% of fatal accidents in the United States. <a href="https://www.geico.com/living/driving/auto/car-safety-insurance/7-ways-to-avoid-road-rage/">
                What is Road Rage? Definition & Causes | GEICO Living. </a>It isn’t difficult to imagine that adequate communication
                could have prevented a healthy percentage of these incidents.<br><br>

                Perhaps a driver is incapacitated for whatever reason and needs assistance. Voice activation of the device is essential for this to work. A voice command
                like “Hey, (device name) alert drivers I need assistance” could be displayed so drivers can call emergency services.<br><br>

                Perhaps a driver is elderly and needs extra time and space. In Japan, elderly drivers are required to display a “clover” sign to inform other drives that
                they may have impaired reaction times and need to give the driver extra distance between cars. Something like this could be a boon for Australian elderly
                drivers. Someone who doesn’t know how to change a tyre could also benefit from such a device.<br><br>

                I know myself that there were times I wish I had a way to communicate safely to other drivers that they need to give me a wide birth.<br><br>

                That’s where the rear windshield display monitor comes in. Attach it to the rear windshield, connect to the dedicated app, choose a message to display and
                off you go.<br><br>
