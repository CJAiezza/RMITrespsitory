          <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m an Australian residing in Japan since 2004. I have a wife and two children.
              In 2003 I graduated at the Australian Institute of Applied Sciences with a diploma in Anatomy and Physiology.
              In 2014, I passed the N1 (highest level) Japanese Language Proficiency Test. Those with this certification can converse in most situations in Japanese culture to a high level.

              My dream as a teenager was to be a musician. I have original music on Spotify and other streaming platforms, an album made with friends here in Japan for runners in which all music is a 180bpm and am halfway through recording an original album with a Japanese bassist and a Chinese singer.
            </p>
          <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
            <p>My interest in IT began when I first had contact with a computer back when I was about 11 or 12 years old. My mum got a cheap computer from Cash            Converters, one with a cassette deck and it came with a book on coding. I remember copying the code to write Black Jack. I very much regret not continuing with that but am looking to make amends now at RMIT. My experience in IT is limited to trial and error, but in my family and friends circle, I’m usually the one people go to for tech help. If anything, I’m able to use Google to solve most tech problems. My hope is to learn to go further and solve programming issues as well.
            </p>
          <h2>Why I Chose RMIT</h2>
            <p>I chose RMIT because they provide an 100% online program and were highly recommended when I posted a question on Reddit about studying IT online as a mature student. Despite my relatively older age, I strongly believe that age is just a number and I can learn how to program, learn how to build an app, learn how to do things I don’t even know I want to learn how to do at RMIT.

              My expectation from studying at RMIT are to learn the ins and outs of IT including programming, troubleshooting, working in groups and other facets of working in the IT industry. As someone who will graduate in my mid-40s, my hope is to despite my age be able to hit the ground running and be at the very least a serviceable contributor and eventually excel.

          <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
              <p>IThis position is for a C++ Software Engineer that will be able to work with and learn from peers with a possibility of future opportunities. It is a job that requires a high level of maturity and attention to detail, as it is a position in defence.
                As someone who is a pacifist while also a realist, working in defence and helping to ensure that clients make “better and more informed” decisions is an exciting prospect. As someone who already lives overseas and dreamt of doing so from a very young age, while I understand that this job is situated in Australia, the idea that organisation being international implies that there may be possibilities of future positions abroad. That is incredibly exciting.

                The job requires exemplary proficiency in C++ and a strong team ethic and team working skills. Excellent communication skills to meet the demands of clients is at the forefront of the company’s needs.

                Currently, I have no knowledge of C++ but do love working in a team and collaborating in teams.

                To meet the demands of this position, it is going to take me to first, complete the degree in IT. Then, further studies in the disciplines outlined in the job advert, Computer Science and physics among them. I have an interest in physics, so earning a degree in physics as a post-grad is also a compelling prospect. I don’t know how much C++ is taught in the Bachelor of IT degree, but if it’s minimal, further study in this area will be conducted post-graduation.
